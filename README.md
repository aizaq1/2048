Introduction:
We have made a version of the game 2048 using GridWorld. Players may combine tiles with the same number to create tiles with larger numbers. The goal of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048 using the specified hotkeys (see below). There is a scoreboard, much like the one in the actual game that records your current score and your highest score.

Directions:
1. Run the Main.java file located in the src folder.
2. Use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the tiles. W will push the tiles up, A to the left, S downward, and D to the right.
3. At the end of the game, whether you win or lose, there will be an option to play again.

A couple notes:
1. The "out" folder contains all of the .class files.
2. Most of our code is written in the ActorWorld.java file under src/info/gridworld/Actor
3. We hope you enjoy our game - we had fun making it.
